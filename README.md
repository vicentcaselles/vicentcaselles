Hi, my name is Vicent Caselles and I am a Bioinformatics and Biostatistics student. I'm strongly interested in data analysis and the potential of computational tools applied in the field of biology.
In this Github repository I will be sharing the code I generate during the course of my MSc coursework, as well as projects and online courses I complete.

Thank you for your time and attention, and any bugs or improvements that you spot, please let me know (I am a beginner, so any input will be greatly appreciated).
